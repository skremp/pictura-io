        This is the public API documentation for the PicturaIO Image Servlet.
        <p>
            PicturaIO is a full configurable, extandable and dependency free (core features) 
            Java Servlet, based on the Servlet API 3.0, to make delivering responsive images 
            for your web applications or apps easy and performant. It helps you dynamically 
            resize, crop, trim, rotate, compress, apply effetcs and convert images for the 
            ever increasing number of different screen sizes and displays with different 
            pixel density. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Essentially, the servlet works like a proxy that lies between image assets and 
            the browser or application requesting them. The servlet API is accessed entirely 
            via placing a prefix before the original image URL. This prefix gives you 
            declarative access to all of the different types of transformation that the
            servlet can perform.
